# bookFinder

## Technical Exercise
**User Story #1:** As a user, I would like to be able to enter an author's full or partial name on the screen, and have the screen
display for me the first 50 matches. The output should be the first 50 results of full author name + book title for authors
matching that search string. Any matches beyond the initial 50 do not need to be saved.

**User Story #2:** As a user, I would like to see all of the historical data of full author names and book titles that have matched my earlier search queries, with duplicates removed. Uniqueness is identified by the combination of full author name and book title.

## Approach
1. Set up environment

4. Create the UI
5. Adjust for UX
